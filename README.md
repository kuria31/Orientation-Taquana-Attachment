## Overview

This project is a Java-based web application that simulates real-world queue systems for transportation services. Using **Spring Boot** and **Thymeleaf**, it demonstrates how queues are used in:

- Vehicle Boarding and Dispatch  
- Dynamic Seat Allocation  
- Ticket Issuance and Passenger Flow  

The simulation provides a clean, web-based interface where users can interact with and visualize the queuing system in action.

## Features

### Vehicle Boarding and Dispatch
- Vehicles are queued and dispatched on a **first-come, first-served** basis.
- Real-time status of boarding and vehicle availability.

### Seat Allocation
- Seats are dynamically assigned to passengers as they enter the system.
- Visual feedback via the UI for seat assignment and availability.

### Dynamic Ticketing
- Passengers are issued tickets based on arrival time.
- The queue ensures an organized, fair ticketing process.
